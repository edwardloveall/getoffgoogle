# Full Integration Suites

## [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)

Description: iCloud is Apple's answer to online services. Including email, an address book, a calendar, document storage and, if you own any Apple decvices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc) the ability to find and manage them should they get lost or stolen. iCloud also integrates iTunes Match, a service that will identify and store your songs in the Apple's cloud. If you're heavily invested in the Apple/iOS life style, iCloud can make a lot of sense.

The first 5gb in storage is free, and if you're just storing documents, emails and even a handful of photos, you're probably fine. If you find your self needing more space or using iTunes Match, there's a [yearly fee](http://www.apple.com/icloud/includes/lightbox-storage.html).

## [Cozi](http://www.cozi.com/)

Description: Cozi is made for families to share a calendar, shopping lists, a family journal and meal scheduling. While it doesn't cover many of Google's flagship features, it could be very useful if all you want to do is coordinate a small group of people that you don't mind sharing a password with. There is both a free, ad supported version and a "Gold" plan with no ads, easier meal planning, internal messages and other minor features. All versions can sync with iCal.
