## [Cozi](http://www.cozi.com/)

Description: Cozi is made for families to share a calendar, shopping lists, a family journal and meal scheduling. While it doesn't cover many of Google's flagship features, it could be very useful if all you want to do is coordinate a small group of people that you don't mind sharing a password with. There is both a free, ad supported version and a "Gold" plan with no ads, easier meal planning, internal messages and other minor features.
