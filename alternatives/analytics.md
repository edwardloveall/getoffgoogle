# Google Analytics Alternatives

## [Mint](http://haveamint.com)

Mint is an analytics platform made by [Shaun
Inman](http://www.shauninman.com/pilation/). It is self-hosted and costs a
one-time fee of $30. Major upgrades (Such as 1.0 to 2.0) are discounted for
users who already own it. Mint does not have the high delay between when someone
visits the site and when it shows up in Mint like Google Analytics does.

## [Clicky](http://getclicky.com)

Clicky is a free analytics service with for-pay plans. Clicky shows real-time
stats and has features such as viewing Tweets that give your site traffic. With
the free plan, only one domain can be tracked at a time and some features are
only available for a limited time. Plans range from $9.95/month ($59.56/year) to
$29.95/month ($179.95/year) and include custom plans if your needs aren't covered
by the others.
