# Google+ Alternatives

## [Facebook](http://facebook.com)

Description: If you somehow missed the boat on Facebook but managed to get into Google Plus, congratulations! I have no idea what you're looking for. Facebook has very similar goals to Google and is equally as privacy sketchy.

Price: Free (Ad supported)

## [everyme](https://everyme.com/)

Description: Everyme is a social networking service that's built around a private network of people you select. You add people with an email address or phone number and send them comments or pictures. The only way to setup everyme is currently through an app on the iPhone/iPod Touch only. However, mebers of your "circle" can comment without the app.
