## [FastMail](http://fastmail.fm/)

Description: FastMail has been around since 1999 and have offered really good mail services since then. Offering IMAP/POP at all levels, SMTP, Ad Free, and hosting on your own domain at higher levels, it's a great alternative to gmail. Fair warning, it doesn't have the fancy web interface that Gmail can offer.

## Your own domain

Description: If you're nerdy enough to have your own domain and website, it's often the case that domain hosts will offer some level of e-mail. The features will of course vary with each domain or hosting company, but it could be plenty for your needs.
